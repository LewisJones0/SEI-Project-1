# SEI Project One: Biblical
## Overview

The first project I did at General Assembly was to develop a game from a selection of 90's classics. Initally I was planning on doing a version of Snake but after some concideration and push from my mentors, I decided to pivot and do an alternative version of Pacman. 

This version of Pacman was inspired by Christian and Greek stories as well as Dantes Inferno and Dungeon Crawler video games from around the 1990's.

The game is about a protagonist that is decending down the levels of a crypt. The game itself represents one level that the protangonist finds himself in.
